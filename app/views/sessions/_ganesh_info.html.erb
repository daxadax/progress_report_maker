is considered to be the Lord of letters and learning. In Sanskrit, the word 
<em>buddhi</em> is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence, wisdom, 
or intellect. In fact, one of Ganesh's names is Buddhipriya.  The word <em>priya</em> can mean 
"fond of", and in a marital context it can mean "lover" or "husband", so Ganesh could be 
called "Fond of Intelligence" or "Buddhi's Husband".
