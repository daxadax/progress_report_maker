		"Ganesh" is a project which began as I spent a long weekend writing progress reports, 
		and has evolved into a much more complex app designed to help you create goals, 
		evaluate your students' progression and chart their successes (or failures) so that you
		can spend your time on the material and the students that need it most.

		If you have comments about the site, a bug to report, suggestions for improvement 
		or a story about how Ganesh has influenced your classroom, please 
		<%= link_to "contact", contact_path %> us!
